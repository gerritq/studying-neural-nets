This repository contains the code and in-depth explanations from the lecture series by Andrej Karpathy (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy)). I have coded along with his lecture series and built up a thorough understanding of the core concepts in language modeling, with the most intriguing lecture being on building a mini-GPT. I will update this repository with more code, explanations, and implementations, along with new modifications.
